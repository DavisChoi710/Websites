				<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p>
					This page was created in order to finish and make a website with the 
					requirements. Some of the required tasks were to make a timeline, 
					record myself and my friend doing an interview with a person, and 
					doing a movie review. The person we chose to interview and cosplay as
					was Thomas Paine, the author of "Common Sense"; and the movie we 
					decided to watch was the 
					<i> Free State of Jones </i>.
